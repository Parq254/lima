        <h1>Return Policy</h1>
        <p>
            Lima is an online agro e-commerce store that offers products on loan to farmers. We deduct the loan amount from the farmers’ produce at the end of the harvest season. We want our customers to be satisfied with our products and services, but we also understand that sometimes they may need to return or exchange an item. This policy explains how we handle returns and refunds at Lima. 
        </p>
        <h2>What items are eligible for return?</h2>
        <p>
            You can return any item that you purchased from Lima within 30 days of delivery, as long as it meets the following conditions:
<ul>
    <li>The item is unused, unopened, and in its original packaging.</li>
    <li>The item is not a perishable, hazardous, or customized product.</li>
    <li>The item is not a product that was offered on loan. </li>
</ul>        
         </p>
         <h2>How do I initiate a return?</h2>
         <p>To initiate a return, please contact our customer service team at support@lima.com or call us at +254 791855264. You will need to provide your order number, the item you want to return, and the reason for the return. We will then send you a return authorization number and instructions on how to ship the item back to us.</p>
        <p>
            <h2>Who pays for the return shipping?</h2>
            <p>You are responsible for paying the return shipping costs, unless the item you received was damaged, defective, or incorrect. In that case, we will cover the return shipping costs and send you a prepaid shipping label.
            </p>
            <h2>How will I receive my refund?</h2>
            <p>Once we receive and inspect your returned item, we will process your refund within 14 days. We will issue the refund to your original payment method, unless you request a different option. If you paid by credit card, the refund may take a few days to appear on your statement.
            </p>
            <h2>What if I have any questions or concerns?</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions or concerns about our return policy, please contact our customer service team at support@lima.com or call us at +254791855264. We are happy to assist you and resolve any issues you may have.</p>
